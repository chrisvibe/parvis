1. get rid of Parvis Game and controller in "Play Game" page
2. add a about page to the right of players page with some text defined under frontend/public/about.txt (or something like this)
3. atm the "play game" page doesnt load players it says: loading players... (we added this message to debug as i wasnt getting the players in my matrix view)
this is strange because i can easily select players to make a game, so they can obviously load


logs atm:

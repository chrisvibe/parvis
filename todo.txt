bug: made game with 10 rounds, filled data to 4 rounds, changed rounds to 3 (looks correct in both Current Standing and Score Progress visualizations), changed rounds to 5, and Current Progress was stuck at 3 rounds, but Score Progress updated correctly. The matrix and all other parts seemed to work as they should.
when i finished the game and looked at historical game data the 3 round current progress table was there and not the 4 round i was expecting. probably the root cause is above...

historical game lookup should allow search for game timestamp too, not just notes, and game id

remove tick boxes in parent selection in player registration. this should be like the historical game lookup search, each time u select one it populated a list under.
